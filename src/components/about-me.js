            I am a full stack developer candidate 
            skilled in writing clean, testable code with a background in 
            project management.   Seeking work where my proficiency in 
            mobile-first responsive design and test-driven development as well 
            as my experience with modern tooling will help any team while 
            also allowing me the ability to learn from my peers. I am excited and 
            able to quickly learn any additional tools needed for the job.  I have 
            a proven track record of learning languages/libraries in under 1 week 
            and fully look forward to learning as much as possible as I help the development 
            team.
